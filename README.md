A Brief of the Prototype:
This project is a Python-based interactive 3-D model visualization tool. It allows users to select and render various 3-D objects such as stars, cubes, cylinders, spheres, pencils, phones, and chairs. The system uses the VTK library for 3-D graphics and provides a simple command-line interface for user input. Each shape is generated using parametric functions and visualized in a window, demonstrating basic 3-D modeling and rendering techniques.

Tech Stack:
Python
VTK (Visualization Toolkit)
Math (for geometric calculations)
Command-line interface
What I Learned:
While developing this prototype, I learned how to use the VTK library for 3-D graphics in Python, how to create parametric models for different shapes, and how to build an interactive application for visualizing 3-D objects. I also gained experience in handling user input and managing multiple object types within a single rendering context.
